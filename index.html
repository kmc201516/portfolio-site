<h2>About Me</h2>

	<br>
	<h3 id="EsportsJourney">Esports Journey </h3> 
	<p> I started competing in esports tournaments in 2015 but did not compete daily until 2019 with the release of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</em>. <br>
I adpoted the logo seen below as my personal logo in the summer of 2020 and you can see some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbZsHuGUnsg" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
