		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p style="font-family: Arial;">
			Hi, my name is Kay and this is my website. I like gaming, music, and chatting with friends. I am transgender and setting records in the Call of Duty scene as the best transgender player. <br>
			I have been playing video games since I was 5 and got really into Call of Duty when I was 10. I currently play competitive Call of Duty on a team called RoseBlade and I have been in the
			top 1% of players for 3 years in a row.<br>

			My favourite genre of music is rap. My favourite artist is Eminem and my favourite rap song is Middle Child By J. Cole.

			I started competing in esports tournaments in 2015 but did not compete daily until 2019 with the release of <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</em>. <br>
			I adpoted the logo seen below as my personal logo in the summer of 2020 when I switched my competitive username from <em>"KMC"</em> to <em>"SiGGht"</em> and you can see some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPDKUHBUK_w" target="_blank"> here</a>. <br>

			I started <em>Modern Warfare</em> playing 1v1s against all the college recruits at <em>Ottawa University</em> to get my name out there. After playing a very close series against one of their best
			players, I caught the eye of their coach. He watched on and off for a few months while me and Harsh "<em>"Kratos"</em> Trivedi played semi pro 2v2s. After closely monitoring my practices and
			games for a few months, the coach asked me to train alongside their 5v5 team. I trained with them multiple times a week and they started dominating in their league matches. Other
			coaches started noticing that I was doing well in practice against this star team and offered me tryouts and scholarships. I was drafted in the Mock Draft as the 3rd overall pick
			by <em>St. Clair College</em>. Since I was having success in competitive 5v5, I quit 2v2s to focus on 5v5 practice. I trained with Ottawa daily until the end of the <em>Modern Warfare 2019</em>
			competitive season. During the offseason, we all moved to <em>Black Ops 4</em> to play wagers. I was not as strong in <em>Black Ops 4</em> but I got a few friends together to play a wager match
			against the 5 best players from Ottawa. At this point, Ottawa is undefeated in the college league so all eyes were on my team to win this wager and stop the invincible team.
			We beat them 3-0 in a best of 5 and they asked to rematch the next day for a lot of money. We won 3-0 again and they never paid us the money they said they would. After this,
			I decided to stop playing <em>Black Ops 4</em> and move to playing competitive <em>Warzone</em>. Since I had a good competitive background already and had a decent presence in the esports scene,
			I was teaming up with great players and once again, eyes were on me to keep up against top <em>Warzone</em> players. I was invited to a CDL Invitational a few months into playing. CDL
			Invitationals have the best players all in the same lobby competing to be last alive. My team focusing on positioning and we ended getting a top 3 finish and donated our $1,000
			to charity. <br>
			<br>
			Fast forward to November 2020: <em>Call of Duty: Cold War</em> releases and I am expected to compete in CCL tryouts in January but I did not have plans to compete in Cold War just yet.
			Resurgence just released on <em>Warzone</em> and Harsh "<em>Kratos</em>" Trivedi and I teamed up again. We were dominating the ranked ladder and were climbing very quickly. We are going into the
			holiday break in the top 10,000 players worldwide. We kept playing and with only a few minutes left in 2020, we won a game and qualified for top 2,000. By the end of New Years Day,
			we were in the top 1,000 of players and I was overcome with emotions knowing my hard work paid off. I injured my wrist that week so I had to take the week off and take care of my wrist.
			After my wrist was better, I had to temporarily retire from competitive <em>Warzone</em> to move to <em>Cold War</em>. I was behind everyone's skill level since I was playing <em>Warzone</em> while they were
			practicing. I quickly caught up to where everyone's skill level was and competed in my first official college match in February 2020. I played as an honorary student for the <em>
				University
				of Waterloo
			</em>. I did not perform well and was insanely disappointed. I lost a lot of viewers after that after they saw I could not convert my skill in practice into high pressure games.
			<br>
			Since then, I have been practicing a lot with my friends and I officially got picked up onto RoseBlade on March 19th, 2021 to compete alongside "<em>gcmd</em>", "<em>TenTen</em>", "<em>MarshaL</em>",
			and "<em>C3DL0RD</em>". Since then, we have picked up 2 more of my old friends."<em>MarshaL</em> was demoted to our second roster and "<em>Minato</em>" took his spot on the main team.
			Joining "<em>MarshaL</em>" on the second roster we have "<em>Drayce</em>","<em>Jonesy</em>", and "<em>C3DL0RD</em>". After beating the #4 team in the college league, we once again started being looked at 
			by college teams. At this moment, my team is competing in qualifiers for the CoD Rec League which has helped a lot of players grow their viewership in an established league.

				For a long time, I always questioned whether or not I was transgender. It kept bothering me having this thought in my head but not doing anything about it. I came out on social media in mid-October 2020.
				Since then, I have come out to family and close friends and started going to a specialized clinic.
